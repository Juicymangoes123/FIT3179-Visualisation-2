                         To investigate any patterns of migration in Australia, we first see how what percentage of
                         international permanent arrivals each state took over the time period 2022-23.
                         Rather unsurprisingly, the two most populous states of Victoria and New South Wales received
                         the most international arrivals, with 32% and 34% respectively.
                         As we can see from the line graph below, most of these permanent arrivals are skilled workers,
                         while another large category is for family reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         An interesting observation is the rapid rise in skilled permanent labour in the Northern
                         Territory. This is no coincidence. In fact, in 2015, the Territory Government introduced
                         a new policy called the "Designated Area Migration Agreement" (DAMA), in an attempt to address
                         labour shortages in industries such as dentistry, nursing, and more recently, software
                         engineers and teachers. Lasting from 2015 to 2019, this agreement saw over 280 employers be
                         granted access to temporary skilled labourers,
                         with an accelerated process to permanent residency. In late 2023, this agreement has been
                         further renewed for 2024, and negotiations are underway for another renewal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         Another interesting observation has been each state's response to the drop in migration due to
                         the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas some states like Victoria have mostly
                         returned to pre-pandemic levels of migration, other states such as Western Australia have not
                         returned to a historical average level of overseas migration. This has led to skilled worker
                         shortages and has seen the WA government move to address the issue. In a deal with the Federal
                         government, roughly 10,000 skilled migration places have been allocated to WA in the financial
                         year 2024-25.
